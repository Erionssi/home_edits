All of my home edits and basically one of the numerous backups of those edits.
Read at your own risk, could be some older stuff and newer stuff mixed up together.

Best work's are:
Libft
Get_next_line

Contents:
42FileChecker - a version of 42FileChecker (made for 42 school projects) with modified files for my tests, credits go to the original creator.
fdf - files for fdf school project, nothing more
fillit - was a coop project and repo is linked to my co-op partner on the project
get_next_line - project to create "get next line" function, originally used just for that, used later in my own libc
init - UNIX VM network and system schoolwork, full of questions/answers for the init project. init/scripts/03 is a custom bash script for testing the whole project
libft-unit-test - another testing enviorment for school libft project and some customization for it (mainly i used debian at home and school used OS X so..)
libft - my version of libc and library of functions that are used in C, tried to make them as simple as possible BUT also secure
libftest - More libft tests for various functions, also some of my own but mainly by the author of the original tests
rush/minisynth/chuck - my early work for the rush project where we had 2days to code a voice synthesizer, i used ChucK language in the end, it also has all the other test and various things that i checked out

ALL THE REST is just more testing programs etc..
