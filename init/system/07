# you could always just check the status of sshd and see the PID there but
# that would be too easy
#
# ps aux shows process information of all processes and their users
# we egrep it to get the information line so you know what is the PID number
# head -2 it so we dont get too much information like egrep process info
ps aux | egrep 'PID|ssh' | head -2
