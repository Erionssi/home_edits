# in this it depends what we mean ast real users?
# users that can login? "cat /etc/passwd | egrep "root|home"" should suffice
# all non-disabled ones? such as sync? "cat /etc/passwd | grep -v nologin"
# all human users? that are not root? "cat /etc/passwd | grep home"
echo "cat /etc/passwd | grep home"
