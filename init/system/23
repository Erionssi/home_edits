# first create a new user using "sudo adduser USERNAME"
# type in password x2, fill in the information that you want
# answer Y when asked if info is correct
# if needed, add it to sudo group "sudo usermod -aG sudo USERNAME"
# if you want to be able to use sudo
# if you want to use the login in your current terminal, use "exit" command to
# log out of the current user, double if you were using root
# open a terminal / VM Graphic / VM Console
# for ssh login use the exercise 17 answer "ssh -p PORT username@ip_address"
# for VM graphic/console session just login as normally with the new user info
#
# you can also just 
# su USERNAME
# after you have created the new user
#
# in GNOME graphics version creating user is done at
# settings -> details -> users, unlock, press add user
#
# SMALL REMINDER, if you have killed the ssh service, you have to restart it,
# before you can login trough ssh again
