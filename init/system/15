# there are multiple ways of doing this but maybe the easiest is to use pkill
# to send a kill signal to the process.
# pkill to kill with a process name,
# kill to kill with process ID, PID. "kill -9 PID"
# you can find both of these with "jobs -l"
# -9 is the signal for SIGKILL as in terminating the process
echo "pkill -9 PROCESS_NAME"
