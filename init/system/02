# from this point on i expect you to have sudo package installed in your
# debian, and that your user is added to the sudo group of that system
# so you can use sudo command.
# WHOLE PROCESS FOR THIS IS:
# su -
# apt update
# apt install sudo
# at this point you could create user by doing "adduser USERNAME"
# usermod -aG sudo USERNAME to add it to the group
# exit && exit to exit root access and logout from your user (you have to relog
# for the group change to take effect)
# now you should have acces to sudo command with your USERNAME
# other way of doing these exercises is to activate root access and do all the
# commands without sudo.
#
# hostname does what you ask but its temporary as we dont change any files to
# reflect the change, so it is in affect only untill boot
echo "sudo hostname USERNAME"
