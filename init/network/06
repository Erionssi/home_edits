# answer is /var/run/resolv.conf
# /etc/resolv.conf has a symbolic link to /var/run/resolv.conf that contains
# the IP address of the DNS server we are using.
# So the answer is: /var/run/resolv.conf
#
# you can also get the information by running the following command.
# to be clear you could just nslookup or dig any domain and see your dns address
# scutil --dns is described in the file above so it could be used also.
# scutil --dns | grep "resolver #1" -A 2 | head -3
echo /var/run/resolv.conf
