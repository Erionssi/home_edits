# NAT is what handles our connecction to the outside world, so it translates
# the trafic coming and going trough it so even if there are multiple computers
# in the same network (like our school networks) we are handled as separate
# clients to web domains etc.
# in our network NAT is named simply nat
# in most cases the second adress that is working in some level of our subnet
# is the Network Address Translator
