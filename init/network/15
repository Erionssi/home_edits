# you can do a simple echo addition to the hosts file,
# unfortunately we have no sudo rights to the hosts file so this is in theory
# only, sudo vim /private/etc/hosts and add "46.19.122.85 intra.42.fr"
# into the hosts file
echo "sudo vim /private/etc/hosts and add 46.19.122.85 intra42.fr line there"
