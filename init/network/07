# you could use dig, nslookup or host to get this information, we use host
# this is because host also shows what address handles the mail and i like that
# dig @8.8.8.8 who.int is bit messy so we dont like it in this case
# nslookup who.int 8.8.8.8 we have basically already used in a way
host who.int 8.8.8.8
