# if we use dig to check who.int's IP we can find out what the provider is
# with some... extra grepping, awking and cutting :D its also called reverse DNS

# dig -x is a reverse address lookup
# then again we do basic grepping, awk to show only the second line after grep
# cuts to delimit tabs and after that spaces
# dig -x 104.17.113.188 | grep "AUTHORITY SECTION" -A 1 | awk 'NR==2' | cut -d$'\t' -f5 | cut -d" " -f2
# on second thought, lets just use simple whois and grep the organisation :D
whois 104.17.113.188 | grep "OrgName"
