# here we have 2 commands, because if you want to do both A and B, you need both
#
# ifconfig en0 is the interface were looking at, 
# grep shows only lines that have broadcast address
# cut delimits by space and shows second and sixth field, 
# they are the inet and broadcast addresses
# if you want a bigger list of your network and what addresses are under
# the samesubnet mask, you could ping your subnet like in the second command
#
# ping -c 2 will ping the address 2 times (needed for pinging the whole subnet), 
# grep lines that have time in them, 
# cut everything out except 4th field, 
# remove dublicates with awk because you pinged twice, 
# sort the list and remove the trailing ":" with sed.
#
# a)
# ifconfig en0 | grep "broadcast" | cut -d " " -f 6
# b)
# ping -c 2 $(ifconfig en0 | grep "broadcast" | cut -d " " -f 6) | grep "time" | cut -d " " -f 4 | awk '!a[$0]++' | sort | sed 's/://'
ifconfig en0 | grep "broadcast" | cut -d " " -f 6
ping -c 2 $(ifconfig en0 | grep "broadcast" | cut -d " " -f 6) | grep "time" | cut -d " " -f 4 | awk '!a[$0]++' | sort | sed 's/://'
